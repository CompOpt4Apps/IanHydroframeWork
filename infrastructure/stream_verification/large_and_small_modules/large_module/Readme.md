# Large Module Version of Stream Verification

## Prerequisites:
Must have:
  - jupyter
  - climata: https://github.com/heigeo/climata


## Running
Run `jupyter notebook` in this or a higher directory.

Using the notebook navigator, open and run the "As Large Module.ipynb" file.

## Discussion
This version of the module is more decomposed, and therefor larger than an alternative, less decomposed implementation (specifically "small_module").

Pros:
+ Comprehensive
+ Big changes easier to make.

Cons:
+ More functions and types to manage.
+ Deeper function-call stacks complicate where and when things happen.
+ Small changes harder to make.
