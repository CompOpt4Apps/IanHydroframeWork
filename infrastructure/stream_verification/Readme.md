If you're reading this: I'm sorry.

Probably the best things to look at right now would be large_module or small_module.
Both *should* be relatively easy to read.
large_module was designed for better long-term development by reasonably skilled python developers, but maybe not by non-developer scientists.
small_module was designed to be better for long-term maintainability by non-developer scientists, at the cost of being more difficult to extend because of simpler but less sophisticated software development practices.
