# Small Module Version of Stream Verification

## Prerequisites:
Must have:
  - jupyter
  - climata: https://github.com/heigeo/climata


## Running
Run `jupyter notebook` in this or a higher directory.

Using the notebook navigator, open and run the "As Small Module.ipynb" file.

## Discussion
This version of the module is less decomposed, with as few new functions as possible, and therefore smaller than an alternative, more decomposed implementation (specifically "large_module").
Pros:
+ Simple to understand.
+ Less to manage.
+ Small changes are easy.

Cons:
+ Potential for code replication and hard-coding.
+ Larger changes more difficult without more decomposition or significant and tedious code replication.
