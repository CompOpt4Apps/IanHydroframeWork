This repository contains several ongoing projects.

# Sinusoidal Test Domain
This is a synthetic, rectilinear test domain that is parameterized for size (among others), allowing size-scaling performance testing with ease.

See `test_domains/sinusoidal/Readme.md` for details.


# Large Ocelote Sinusoidal Test
This test is a set of parameters to the Sinusoidal test domain that achieves a 96.88% occupation of the 168GiB of memory available on a node in the UArizona HPC system, Ocelote.

See `test_domains/sinusoidal/Readme.md`, "Large Squarish" subsection (under section "Specific Parameter-Sets of Interest") for details.


# ParFlow Estimator Tool
Tool for consuming ParFlow tcl scripts and producing estimates of the runtime and memory footprint.
See `tools/ParFlowEstimator/Readme.md` for details
